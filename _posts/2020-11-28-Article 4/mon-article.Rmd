- General topic
    + The bird population in the US (mainly into grassland) is in the rapid decline, probably caused by using a pesticide called neonicotinoid. 
    
- Procedure/what was examined
    + During a seven-year time period (from 2008 to 2014), they analyzed bird populations in relation to changes in pesticide use and agricultural crop acreage. The scientists using data from hundreds of bird species across the US in four different categories (grassland birds, non-grassland birds, insectivores, and non-insectivores). 
They also examined whether intensified agricultural production and conversion of grassland to agricultural land also contributed to the bird decline. 
    
- Conclusions/ discovery
    + They found robust evidence of the negative impact of neonicotinoids, in particular on grassland birds, and to some extent on insectivore birds even if the effect of neonicotinoids could result directly from birds consuming treated crop seeds, and indirectly by affecting the insect populations they feed on.
The search shows a 2.2% decline in populations of grassland birds and 1.6% in insectivorous birds with an increase of 100 kilograms in neonicotinoid usage per county, to compare to other pesticide the neonicotinoids is more dangerous for birds.
