# Analysis of the study

- Researchers? 
    + The researchers of the Biodiversity Unit at the University of Turku.

- Published in? when (if mentioned)?
    + 5 March 2021  

- General topic
    + The trade of scorpions for their venom is in increased, this led to a vast number of scorpions are harvested from nature for commerce and farm. This traffic is endangering the future of several scorpion species in a number of areas by overexploitation of scorpions for their venom.

- Procedure/what was examined
    + The first problem to stopping the endangered of scorpions is our understanding of her. The information about scorpion’s species is very poor. So, the first works of the scientist is to mapping out species in poorly documented areas in order to produce more information about unknow species to bring a better comprehension of the causes and facts about the specie’s extinction.  
    
- Conclusions/ discovery
    + The harvest of scorpion’s venom will bring quickly 
many species to the list of endangered species, million different species will be in this situation in the next decades if the illegal trade development is not slowed down.
The population growth and the related unsustainable overexploitation of natural resources as well as overharvest/trade might cause this several decline, especially species with a small range.
If a lot of species become extinct, we also lose all the possibilities that their complex venoms could offer, for example, to drug development and other possibilities.
